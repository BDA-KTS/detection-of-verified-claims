# SimBa: Lexical and Semantic Similarity Based Detection of Verified Claims

## Description

This method receives an input claim/sentence (called "query"), searches a registry of fact-checked claims and returns fact-checks for similar claims. More precisely, SimBa computes the queries' similarity with ~40.000 english fact-checked claims from ClaimsKG and returns a set of ranked claims, their relevance scores, veracity ratings and the corresponding fact-check sources.

This method facilitates fact-checking of arbitrary claims or statements (e.g. taken from online discourse and social media posts). It takes advantage of a unique and constantly updated repository of fact-checked claims mined from the web (ClaimsKG).

ClaimsKG is a structured knowledge base (KB) which serves as a registry of claims. The KB is updated at regular intervals. The latest release of ClaimsKG contains 74000 claims collected from 13 different fact-checking websites. For more details regarding ClaimsKG, please refer to the official webpage [https://data.gesis.org/claimskg/](https://data.gesis.org/claimskg/)

## Use Cases

1. **Veracity Verification**: Check whether a set of statements have already been fact-checked before. SimBa can be used on these statements to find existing fact-checks, including who performed the checks and when they were done.
2. **Check-Worthiness Analysis**: Find out which claims have been fact-checked before and which have not to gain information on perceived check-worthiness of statements
3. **Information Spread Analysis**: Find claims that are semantically similar to claims that have been previously fact-checked to analyze information spread

## Input Data

The required input consists of an input query file [`data/sample/queries.tsv`](data/sample/queries.tsv): a text file in .tsv format (tab-separated) containing one query per line. One query consists of an ID and a claim. For each of the claims, SimBa will retrieve the most similar fact-checked claims in ClaimsKG.

Example of [`data/sample/queries.tsv`](data/sample/queries.tsv):
```
1	Covid-19 vaccines increase the risk of dying from the new Covid-19 variants
```

Optional input data: If desired, a different corpus than ClaimsKG can be supplied as database ([`data/claimsKG/corpus.tsv`](data/claimsKG/corpus.tsv)).

This file should be in tab-separated format (`.tsv`) and must follow the structure below:

Format of [`corpus.tsv`](data/claimsKG/corpus.tsv)

The file should contain the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| qid | A unique identifier for the claim |
| text | The textual content of the claim |
| title | The title of the fact-checking review |
| url | A link to the fact-checking article |
| rating | The fact-checking assessment of the claim (e.g., true, false, half false, etc.) |

If available, a goldstandard file can be supplied which lists the optimal results.  

For example, SimBa can be evaluated directly on the CLEF CheckThat! data using the respective datasets and gold files.  
You can also use the same evaluation scripts to evaluate SimBaâ€™s performance on your *own data*, provided you supply a goldstandard file (gold.tsv) in the same folder as your input claims file (e.g., data/<dataset>/gold.tsv).

## Output Data

The outputs are exported to two files:

### 1. Standard Output File: [`data/sample/sample.tsv`](data/sample/sample.tsv)

Contains the results in a tab-separated format with the following columns:

| Query ID | Q0 | Claim ID | Rank | Similarity Score | Method Name |

### 2. Client-Friendly Output File: [`data/sample/pred_client.tsv`](data/sample/pred_client.tsv)

## Hardware Requirements

The method requires higher hardware specifications for optimal performance. Below is the recommended machine configuration:

- **CPU**: 8-core x86 CPU (e.g., Intel Core i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9)
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with at least 4GB VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 2000 or higher. Not compulsory but important for faster operations)
- **RAM**: 8 GB or more
- **Storage**: 256 GB SSD (for faster read/write operations) + 256 GB HDD (for additional storage)

**Note**: While the above specifications are recommended for optimal performance, SimBa can still run on more modest hardware. It has been successfully tested on a virtual machine with limited resources, though processing times will be significantly longer. The `-c` cache option becomes particularly helpful when working with limited hardware.

## Environment Setup

This version of SimBa has been tested with **Python 3.11.13** on Windows. Using other Python versions and/or operating systems might require other package versions.

Follow the steps below to install SimBa on your system using the recommended setup.

### 1. Install Python (Version 3.11.13)

- **Download Python 3.11.13** from the official Python website:  
   [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31113/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31113/).

- **Install Python**:
    - **During installation**, make sure to **check the box** that says **"Add Python to PATH"**. This step is crucial, as it ensures that Python and pip (Python's package manager) are available in your terminal or command prompt.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

- **Verify the Installation**: 
    After installation, open your terminal (or command prompt) and type the following command to check if Python was installed correctly:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

### 2. Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Main Project Directory

To download SimBa, clone the repository from GitHub.

Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository name>
```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies and Data

SimBa's required libraries and dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. Install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## How to Use

Once everything is installed, you can run the SimBa project. To do so, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python main.py sample
```

Or more generally:

```bash
python main.py <dataset name>
```

**Parameters:**
- `<dataset name>`: A custom name for your input query dataset (e.g., "sample"). SimBa will automatically look for the input file at `data/<dataset name>/queries.tsv`.

This will use the ClaimsKG database to find fact-checked claims that are similar to your input queries.
The results will be written to the folder of your dataset, e.g.:  

- `data/<dataset>/pred_client.tsv` : human-readable output (claims, URLs, ratings, similarity scores)  
- `data/<dataset>/pred_qrels.tsv` : standard format for evaluation

### Using Cache for Efficiency

For increased efficiency, SimBa generates embeddings for the claims in each database only once and stores them in a cache for re-use. To use this cache, if it already exists, supply the `-c` option:

```bash
python main.py <dataset name> -c
```
### Using Cache for Efficiency and Quick Testing

SimBa now comes with **pre-computed embeddings** for both queries and the default fact-checking corpus (`ClaimsKG`).  

- **Query embeddings** are stored in: `data/cache/sample/*`  
- **Target embeddings** (ClaimsKG corpus) are stored in: `data/cache/claimsKG/*`  

These allow you to run the system **without recomputing embeddings** from scratch, saving significant time and resources.  

You can quickly test the system in the interactive environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or terminal) by running:

```bash
python main.py sample -c

- The `-c` option enables the use of cached embeddings.
- The default query file is located at `data/sample/queries.tsv`.

 **Important**: If you plan to use a different database or modify the corpus, make sure to regenerate the embeddings accordingly, or remove the cache to force regeneration.


## Technical Details

SimBa is fully unsupervised, i.e. it does not need any training data. It operates in two steps:

1. **Candidate Retrieval**: The semantically most similar claims are retrieved as candidates. Semantic similarity is computed using sentence embeddings.
2. **Re-Ranking**: A computationally more costly re-ranking step is applied to all candidates in order to find the best matches. Again, sentence embeddings combined with a lexical feature are used.

SimBa was evaluated on the [CLEF CheckThat! Lab Task 2 Claim Retrieval challenge](https://checkthat.gitlab.io/clef2022/) data and achieved the following scores:

| Dataset | Map@1 | Map@3 | Map@5 |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2020 2a English | 0.9425 | 0.9617 | 0.9617 |
| 2021 2a English | 0.9208 | 0.9431 | 0.9450 |
| 2021 2b English | 0.4114 | 0.4388 | 0.4414 |
| 2022 2a English | 0.9043 | 0.9258 | 0.9258 |
| 2022 2b English | 0.4462 | 0.4744 | 0.4805 |
